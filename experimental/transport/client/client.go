// Package client defines an EXPERIMENTAL, purpose-built public contract for a
// pluggable client-side gRPC transport. It lets an out-of-tree transport (for
// example a shared-memory transport) be selected and driven by grpc-go WITHOUT
// importing google.golang.org/grpc/internal/*.
//
// # Stability
//
// EXPERIMENTAL. The shapes here are deliberately minimal and grpc-go-native
// (not a commitment to grpc/proposal#103 / L37). No compatibility is promised
// until at least one independent transport and one fake transport pass the
// conformance suite. Do NOT depend on this from production code.
//
// # Design
//
// The mandatory send path is BYTE-BASED: ClientStream.Write takes already-framed
// bytes, ReadMessageHeader+Read hand ring/buffer-backed bytes upward (Read
// returns a ref-counted mem.BufferSlice, which is how read-side zero-copy
// survives a clean transport boundary). Marshalling an application message
// directly into transport-owned memory (the INLINE_TX fast path) is an OPTIONAL
// capability, ProtoWriteStream, detected by interface assertion; grpc-go
// transparently falls back to Write when it is absent or declines.
//
// The option types (BuildOptions, CallHdr, WriteOptions) are PURPOSE-BUILT
// by-value structs carrying only what a transport legitimately consumes. They
// are intentionally NOT aliases of any internal option struct: aliasing would
// freeze internal layout as a public compatibility obligation. Concerns above
// the transport seam (channelz, RPC stats, tap, socket buffer tuning) are
// deliberately excluded.
