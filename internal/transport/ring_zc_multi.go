// Multi-anchor single-frame zero-copy receive.
//
// Replaces the at-most-one-ZC binary gate (zcActive) in
// IsSpeculativeZCEligible with a bounded ordered FIFO of up to
// zcAnchorBudgetCount in-flight anchors. Each anchor records the
// (start, end) absolute byte range of a single DATA-frame payload
// held by a consumer-side mem.Buffer. Consumers release the buffer
// (typically inside proto.Unmarshal's read of the bytes), which
// transitions the slot to "released"; a prefix-walk advances
// header.ReadIdx through the contiguous released prefix.
//
// Concurrency model:
//
//   - Begin (BeginMultiAnchor) is called by the SINGLE reader
//     goroutine that runs the codec parse loop. No CAS needed on
//     the tail pointer.
//   - Release (anchor.Release) is called from arbitrary consumer
//     goroutines (any goroutine that holds the mem.Buffer and is
//     about to Free it).
//   - drainReleasedAnchorPrefix is MPMC-safe via CAS on the head
//     pointer; multiple racing releasers all converge on the
//     correct final head and the published header.ReadIdx is
//     monotonic-forward via publishTarget's CAS loop.
//
// Why this lifts the single-anchor restriction:
//
//   - The single-anchor scheme freezes header.ReadIdx for the
//     entire ZC duration of ONE frame. With 1000 concurrent
//     streams sharing one ring, 999 concurrent receives fall back
//     to the single-frame copy path because zcActive is already
//     held.
//   - Multi-anchor allows up to zcAnchorBudgetCount concurrent ZC
//     frames in flight at the same time. Each anchor independently
//     tracks its byte range; head advances through the prefix as
//     anchors release in any order. Out-of-order release stalls
//     the prefix advance until the head anchor also releases —
//     wire-correct but momentarily over-conservative on ReadIdx.
//
// Why this is NOT the previously-reverted D-lite design:
//
//   - D-lite (commit 912202af4, reverted) used a sync.Mutex
//     (zcAnchorsMu) around Begin and Release. At 1000 concurrent
//     streams the mutex churn was the dominant cost — D-lite
//     regressed -26 % on N=100/size=4096 even at 99 % ZC hit rate.
//     This implementation is lock-free: head/tail are
//     atomic.Uint64, slot.state is atomic.Uint32, and no mutex is
//     held on the hot path.
//   - D-lite's BeginAnchor passed a stale commitReadIdx capture as
//     each new anchor's start. Multiple anchors got identical
//     overlapping ranges. We use zcDeferredTarget as the running
//     offset (which the BeginAnchor fix 3bc8f7da later adopted)
//     and start fresh from header.ReadIdx only when no anchors
//     are in flight.

// zcAnchorBudgetCount caps in-flight single-frame ZC anchors per ring.
// Sized for the bench's 1000-concurrent-streams profile: at 1000
// streams pipelining 1 message in flight each, a 256-slot ring lets
// any 256 streams hold ZC bytes while the other 744 fall back to
// single-frame copy. In practice released slots cycle quickly
// (proto.Unmarshal holds the bytes for ≤ a few µs) so the steady-state
// occupancy is much lower than 256.
//
// Memory cost: zcAnchorBudgetCount × sizeof(anchorSlot). With 64-byte
// padded slots, 256 slots = 16 KiB per ring. Two data rings per
// transport (TX, RX) = 32 KiB per connection. Acceptable for the
// ZC throughput gain.
const zcAnchorBudgetCount = 256

// anchorSlot is one entry in the multi-anchor FIFO. Padded to a 64-byte
// cache line to prevent false sharing between adjacent in-flight
// anchors under concurrent Release.
//
// State machine:
//
//	0 (free)      → 1 (in-flight): Begin claims, writes start/end
//	1 (in-flight) → 2 (released):  anchor.Release marks done
//	2 (released)  → 0 (free):      drainReleasedAnchorPrefix frees
//
// Memory ordering: state.Store(1) in Begin uses sequential
// consistency (Go's atomic.Uint32 default), which establishes
// happens-before with any subsequent state.Load() in drainPrefix /
// Begin. start/end are atomic.Uint64 (not plain) because
// drainReleasedAnchorPrefix's nextSlot.start read at
// [drainReleasedAnchorPrefix#newCur<tail branch] does NOT first
// check nextSlot.state — the safety hand-off there relies only on
// anchorTail.Load() > newCur (release/acquire on anchorTail).
// Under slot reuse (anchorTail wraps past budget back to the same
// slot position), a stale walker can race with a new Begin's plain
// store on the SAME slot.start/end. Making both sides atomic
// eliminates the race without changing the happens-before contract
// established by state and anchorTail.

//  3. atomic Store slot.state = 1 (publishes start/end to drain).
//  4. atomic Store anchorTail = seq+1 (publishes slot existence to drain).
//  5. atomic Store zcActive = 1.
//
// Step 4 BEFORE step 5 is the contract drain relies on: drain may
// race Store(zcActive=0) between any two steps; its re-check of
