// shmFrameWriter provides a dedicated writer goroutine with an MPSC queue for
// serializing frame writes to a shared-memory ring buffer. This eliminates
// contention from multiple stream goroutines competing for a write lock.
//
// Design:
//   - Callers enqueue frameEntry structs via the channel (lock-free producer side).
//   - A single writer goroutine drains the channel and writes frames to the ring.
//   - Callers that need synchronous completion (e.g., HEADERS that must know if
//     the write failed) set a doneCh on the entry and wait for it.
//
// Shutdown safety:
//   - close() marks the writer as closed and closes the channel.
//   - Channel-send paths (trySend, enqueueOrInlineNonBlocking,
//     enqueueAndWait, enqueueMessageAndWait) hold closeMu.RLock
//     around the closed check + chan send so the channel is never
//     sent to after close.
//   - The inline-write path (tryInlineWrite) does NOT hold closeMu;
//     it relies on inlineMu + the post-lock closed.Load() check.
//     close() drains inlineMu (drainInline barrier) after wg.Wait,
//     so any inline writer that already TryLocked inlineMu before
//     close set the closed flag runs to completion against a still-
//     mapped ring before close proceeds to teardown.

	// callback receives the streamID of the just-emitted DATA chunk
	// and is expected to drain the transport's connection-level WU
	// accumulator AND that stream's pending WU into additional ring
	// writes that ride out in the same SPSC writer position.
	//
	// This is the "outbound piggyback" optimisation: a WU emitted in
	// the same inlineMu hold as an outbound DATA frame costs ~100 ns
	// marginal (just the additional Reserve+Commit; the ring batch's
	// reader-wake signal is amortised across both writes) versus
	// ~200-250 ns for a standalone WU that goes through
	// enqueueOrInlineNonBlocking and either re-acquires inlineMu or
	// detours via the writer channel + writeLoop. Under sustained
	// 1000-stream traffic the receiver-side WU producer effectively
	// piggybacks onto every outbound DATA chunk for ~free, removing
	// the standalone-emit cost from the hot path almost entirely.
	//
	// Callback contract:
	//   - Runs under inlineMu (do not re-acquire)
	//   - May call writeFrame(w.tx, ...) directly to add frames
	//   - Must do O(1) work — typically drain conn pendingWU + the
	//     specific stream's pendingWU only. Walking all streams is
	//     the responsibility of drainPendingWUFn (called on
	//     wuRetryWake), not the per-chunk piggyback.
	//   - Must be non-blocking (no external IO)
	//
	// Implementations on ShmClientTransport and ShmServerTransport
	// look up the *Stream by streamID, check streamDone state, and

// but turns into a producer/consumer LOCKSTEP when the burst contains
// many large MESSAGE entries: the writer can fill the ring while the

// lets the reader make progress before the entire batch finishes.

// 16 KiB H2 frames) to ~460 MB/s (shm-tuned, single 64 KiB frames).
// Adding SHM_MAX_FRAME_SIZE=16384 on top of shm-tuned recovered to
// ~1240 MB/s, isolating the variable to H2 frame cadence -- i.e. the
// reader's per-Commit wake granularity. With chunking the inner
// emitH2DataFromCursor already opens nested ring/8 signal-batches,
// but those inner EndBatch calls only DECREMENT batchDepth (the
// signal still waits for the outer EndBatch). So chunking only helps
// because each entry's body is committed in finer reservation chunks,
// making the deadlock-guard wake fire earlier in single-entry mode.
// To pipeline at the writer-loop scale we need to release the batch
// every signalBatchBytes of accumulated body, opening a fresh one
// immediately so subsequent entries continue under suppression.
//

// tryInlineWrite attempts to emit the whole message as a single H2
// DATA frame directly from the sender goroutine, bypassing the
// channel + writer-goroutine handoff that enqueueMessageAndWait
// normally takes.
//
// Motivation. At low stream concurrency (~10s-100s of streams) the
// existing channel path's per-message wall time is dominated by
// goroutine scheduling: sender sends to channel (~100 ns), runtime
// schedules the writer goroutine (~1 µs), writer processes one
// entry, futex_wakes the reader (~1 µs syscall), reader scheduler
// fires (~1 µs). The actual ring memcpy is a small fraction. At
// high concurrency the existing path amortises beautifully — one
// writer wake drains many entries, one futex_wake covers many
// frames — and convincingly beats UDS by 15+% (see
// grpc-go-shm-beat-uds-roadmap-2026-05-28.md). The hybrid added
// here keeps the high-concurrency win intact while reclaiming the
// low-concurrency latency.
//
// Return contract. Returns (true, err) once the inline path has
// taken responsibility for the message — the caller MUST NOT fall
// back to the channel path even if err is non-nil. Returns
// (false, nil) for all eligibility bails; the caller continues to
// the existing channel + writer-goroutine path with no state change.
//
// Eligibility checks, ordered cheapest-first so each bail returns
// fast:
//
//  1. payloadLen ∈ (0, shmMaxFrameSize]. Zero-length messages
//     (client half-close, etc.) go through the channel path's
//     specialised handler. Oversized messages need the writer
//     goroutine's chunking + FC-defer machinery.
//
//  2. inlineMu.TryLock(). The writer goroutine holds inlineMu for
//     its entire drain pass. A successful TryLock proves no
//     writer-goroutine batch is in flight; the inline path will
//     run alone until it Unlocks.
//
//  3. !closed, stream not done, ctx live. Each is checked AFTER
//     the lock so a concurrent close racing with the TryLock loses
//     to the close path's lock acquisition.
//
//  4. len(w.ch) == 0 AND len(w.deferred) == 0. This is the
//     batching-preservation gate. Whenever ANY work is queued the
//     channel path's batched drain is strictly better (one wake
//     covers many frames). Bailing here means the high-concurrency
//     workload (N=1000 streams ping-ponging) virtually never
//     fires the inline path — its batched throughput stays unchanged.
//
//  5. stream and conn outbound FC quotas each cover payloadLen.
//     Insufficient quota means we'd need the writer goroutine's
//     deferred-retry machinery; bailing back to the channel path
//     keeps that one canonical path.
//
//  6. CAS-deduct both quotas atomically. A CAS race here can only
//     come from the reader's addSendQuota (incoming WINDOW_UPDATE
//     applied on conn quota); we bail rather than retry-spin
//     because the channel path can pick up the larger window cleanly.
//
// Concurrency invariant. inlineMu serialises EVERY ring write —
// both this inline path and the writer goroutine — so at most one
// goroutine touches the ring at a time. Publish order equals lock
// acquisition order. There is no reservation list, no CAS-reserve
// race, no commit-vs-publish split (in contrast to any multi-anchor
// ZC publish scheme, where concurrent reserve-but-not-yet-published
// anchors can race the prefix-walk publisher into back-pressure
// jams). Even when our CAS on connQuota loses to a reader's
// addSendQuota, the explicit rollback + fall-through to the
// channel path preserves the lock-acquisition publish order.
