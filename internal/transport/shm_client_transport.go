// unlocks. Opportunistically drains the connection-level pending WU
// accumulator AND the just-written stream's pendingWU into additional
// ring writes that share the same SPSC writer position — but ONLY
// when the accumulator has reached wuThreshold, mirroring the
// standalone sendConnWindowUpdate / sendStreamWindowUpdate batching
// gate. Sub-threshold credit is intentionally left for the next
// standalone emission or wuRetryWake retry-drain so the piggyback
// does not defeat WU batching.
//
// LOCK ORDERING (must hold): this callback runs WITH inlineMu held
// and acquires t.mu.RLock via lookupStream's slow path (on stream-
// cache miss). The reverse order — t.mu.Lock acquired then waiting
// on inlineMu — must NEVER occur anywhere in the codebase or this
// will deadlock. Many paths take t.mu.Lock (NewStream, closeStream,
// updateFlowControl, SetAuthInfo, Close, keepalive, GracefulClose,
// etc.), but none of them call into the writer goroutine or acquire
// inlineMu while holding t.mu.Lock. The ZC fast-path acquireSendQuota
// takes inlineMu directly (without holding t.mu), and the writer
// goroutine acquires inlineMu in writeLoop (no t.mu held). Verified
// safe across both client and server transports.
//
// Performance: O(1) work — one conn-level atomic Swap, one stream
// pointer lookup (lock-free via cachedStream MRU fast path on
// single-stream connections; mu.RLock-protected map otherwise), and
// at most one per-stream atomic Swap, plus one writeFrame per
// non-zero Swap. When no WU is pending (the common case after the
// first chunk of a sustained transfer has already drained the
// accumulator), the function returns after two atomic Loads and adds
// ~3 ns to the chunk write.
//
// Why no enqueueOrInlineNonBlocking: we are already in the writer's
// inlineMu hold. Routing back through the non-blocking enqueue
// helper would either re-acquire the lock we hold (deadlock) or
// detour via the writer's async channel (defeats the piggyback).
