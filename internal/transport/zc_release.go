package transport

// zcChainReleasePool implements mem.BufferPool. Each chunk emitted by
// readFrameView during a multi-frame ZC chain (or single-frame ZC, which
// is treated as a chain of size 1) wraps its ring slice in a buffer
// backed by this pool. The Put callback decrements the per-ring
// zcInFlight counter; only when the count reaches 0 AND the chain has
// been closed by the codec (chainOpen=0) does EndZcReservation fire and
// publish the deferred ReadIdx in one shot.
//
// This guarantees the cross-process writer never sees a header.ReadIdx
// pointing inside any still-held chain segment.
//
// Get returns a small heap allocation: gRPC's mem.Buffer occasionally
// asks the pool for new buffers (e.g., when growing for split). These
// allocations are independent of the ring slice and don't need to
// touch the ring.

	ring *ShmRing

	// unmapped (race with shutdown). The atomic load is cheap (~1ns).

	// we run ReleaseChainZcBuffer on still-valid memory; a "1" means
	// we skip it (leak is acceptable at shutdown).
