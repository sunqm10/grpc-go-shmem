// This file is the single source of truth for runtime tunables that the
// shared-memory transport reads from process environment variables.
// Centralising the reads here makes the configuration surface auditable
// for security and gRFC review, and gives downstream readers one place
// to look when they ask "what knobs does this transport expose at run
// time?".
//
// Design conventions
//
//   - Every env var read by SHM production code that influences
//     on-ring or on-wire behaviour MUST be declared and read in this
//     file. Pure diagnostic / debug-log knobs (GRPC_SHM_DEBUG,
//     GRPC_SHM_FUTEX_DEBUG) are read at the source where they gate
//     logging because they have no semantic effect on the transport;
//     they are listed in the Knobs section below for discoverability.
//     Test / benchmark scaffolding knobs (BENCH_PROFILE,
//     BENCH_DIRTY_DEFAULT_POOL, SHM_SPIN_ITERS, SHM_BENCH_CPU,
//     SHM_BENCH_ZC) are local to bench harness files and not part of
//     the production runtime API.
//
//   - Programmatic toggles preferred. Deployment-time mode switches
//     (eventfd waker, spin-then-block tuning) are exposed as
//     exported Configure* functions in the transport package rather
//     than env vars. This is the same pattern as
//     ConfigureShmSpinIterations / ConfigureShmFlowControlForBench.
//     Env vars are reserved for things that genuinely cannot be
//     expressed as in-process API: cross-process child identity
//     (set by the parent), and per-process diagnostic logging.
//
//   - Defaults are production-safe. A fresh process with none of these
//     set runs with the eventfd waker ON (Linux only; non-Linux uses
//     the futex / Windows-event fallback layer) and the HTTP/2-
//     compatible flow-control profile (the only profile in the
//     current transport).
//
// Knobs (alphabetical)
//
//   GRPC_CROSS_PROCESS_CHILD
//       Set to a non-empty value when the current process is the child
//       half of a cross-process SHM connection that was spawned via
//       experimental SCM_RIGHTS handoff. Disables eventfd-based wake
//       primitives that today still assume same-process file
//       descriptors. Used as a guard until cross-process FD passing
//       lands.
//
//   GRPC_SHM_DEBUG  (diagnostic only; read at ring.go init)
//       Non-empty enables verbose ring-buffer debug logging on
//       stderr. Has no effect on on-wire behaviour.
//
//   GRPC_SHM_FUTEX_DEBUG  (diagnostic only; read at
//                          shm_futex_{linux,windows}.go init)
//       Non-empty enables verbose futex syscall logging. Has no
//       effect on on-wire behaviour.
//
// Removed knobs (do not reintroduce without strong reason)
//
//   SHM_DATASEG_WAKE   - was the eventfd-waker opt-in. eventfd is now
//                        the default wake primitive on Linux (toggle
//                        for tests / bench: ConfigureShmEventfdWakerForBench).
//   SHM_NO_WU          - was the no-WINDOW_UPDATE opt-in. The NoWU
//                        mode has been REMOVED; HTTP/2-compatible flow
//                        control is now the only profile and NoWU-
//                        equivalent throughput is achieved by setting a
//                        large initial window (default 32 MiB).
//   SHM_INPROC_WAKE    - was a same-process bench-only wake registry;
//                        removed for being unrepresentative of real
//                        deployments.

// shmEnv is the package-private bag of env-derived booleans. All
// fields are evaluated exactly once at init time.

	crossProcessChild bool
