// This file implements flow control mechanisms for the shared memory transport.
//
// RFC A73 Phase 5: Flow Control Alignment
//
// The shared memory transport uses its own optimized flow control constants
// that differ from HTTP/2's defaults because local shared memory has near-zero
// RTT and much higher bandwidth than TCP:
//
// - Initial window size: 32 MB (vs HTTP/2's 64 KB) to avoid stalling on
//   WindowUpdate round-trips for large local RPCs.
// - Maximum BDP window: 64 MB (vs HTTP/2's 16 MB) to fully utilize local
//   memory bandwidth.
// - WindowUpdate batching: deltas are accumulated and only sent when they
//   exceed shmWindowUpdateThreshold (8 MB), reducing control frame overhead.
// - BDP estimation: same exponential moving average algorithm as HTTP/2 but
//   with the higher shmBDPLimit ceiling.
//
// Key SHM-specific constants:
//   - shmInitialWindowSize = 32 MB: initial per-stream window
//   - shmBDPLimit = 64 MB: maximum BDP window
//   - shmWindowUpdateThreshold = 8 MB: batching threshold
//
// BDP algorithm constants (shared with HTTP/2):
//   - alpha = 0.9: Smoothing factor for RTT estimation
//   - beta = 0.66: Threshold for BDP increase trigger
//   - gamma = 2: Multiplicative factor for BDP growth
//
// Note: gRPC dial/server options (WithInitialWindowSize, etc.) do NOT currently
// override the SHM-specific constants. The SHM transport always uses the
// hardcoded values above. This may change in a future revision.

// SHM-specific flow control. Unlike HTTP/2 over TCP, shared memory is
// local with near-zero RTT, so production tunes the per-stream window
// much higher than the 65535-byte HTTP/2 default to avoid WindowUpdate
// round-trips during bulk streaming.
//
// The size knobs below are package-level `var`s rather than `const`s
// so benchmark / test code can switch the SHM transport into a fair-
// comparison profile (matching the HTTP/2 default window used by the
// in-tree TCP and Unix-socket benchmarks). Production code MUST NOT
// mutate these from the data plane — the transport reads them once
// at construction (for `initialWindowSize` and the conn / stream
// quota initial values) and on every WindowUpdate emission (for the
// batching threshold). Use ConfigureShmFlowControlForBench from test
// setup BEFORE any transport is dialed or listened.

	// write overhead. Default is shmInitialWindowSize/4 = 8 MiB.
	// ConfigureShmFlowControlForBench keeps the relationship sane:
	// if the threshold ever exceeded the effective window the sender
	// would deadlock (the consumer can never accumulate enough to
	// trigger a WindowUpdate before the producer exhausts the window).
	shmWindowUpdateThreshold = shmInitialWindowSize / 4

	// shmMaxFrameSize bounds the body of a single H2 DATA frame the
	// producer emits. Defaults to the RFC 7540 ceiling (16 MiB - 1)
	// because SHM is local and per-frame overhead is negligible.
	// HTTP/2 over TCP / UDS in this codebase uses the HTTP/2 spec
	// default of 16384 bytes; bench code can match it via
	// ConfigureShmFlowControlForBench so SHM and TCP / UDS emit the
	// same number of DATA frames per write. The receiver always
	// accepts up to the RFC ceiling regardless of this knob.

	//
	// We empirically validated window/4 vs window/2: under streaming
	// the smaller threshold pipelines better — the producer receives
	// a steady trickle of small credits and never fully drains the

//
// Bounds:
//   - 1 KiB floor: avoid emitting a WU per byte under tiny windows

//   - window/4 default: matches HTTP/2 spec heuristic and pipelines
//     well under streaming
//
// initialWindow <= 0 falls back to the package-global default (set
// by ConfigureShmFlowControlForBench or the build-time constant).
// This is the correctness fix for a real deadlock: previously,
// sendWindowUpdate used `shmWindowUpdateThreshold` directly, so a
// transport dialed with grpc.WithInitialWindowSize(65535) inherited
// the 8 MiB threshold from the package global (computed from the
// 32 MiB shm-tuned default). The receiver's onRead would emit
// 16 KiB credits, sendWindowUpdate would accumulate them, but the

// shmEnsureStreamWindow raises the stream's inbound flow-control limit so
// that a single logical gRPC message (LPM) of n bytes fits inside the
// window, and returns the WINDOW_UPDATE delta the caller must emit (0 if
// the window already covers n).
//
// Why the window has to grow rather than be pre-credited via inFlow.delta:
//
// inFlow.delta is a *loan*. maybeAdjustAdditive lends the sender enough
// extra credit to finish one oversized message, and inFlow.onRead repays
// the loan by withholding an equal number of bytes from the WINDOW_UPDATE
// it would otherwise emit when the application reads that message. That is
// balanced only when a loan is taken at most once per message and repaid by
// that same message's read.
//
// The SHM transport breaks that assumption. Pre-credit fires per LPM at
// parse time (onMessageStart), not per application read, so when messages
// are pipelined the loans accumulate in a single delta pool while onRead
// drains that pool at the rate the application consumes bytes. Once the
// pool is larger than the message being read, the read emits no
// WINDOW_UPDATE at all, and the sender is never re-credited for bytes it
// has already delivered. Every oversized message therefore erodes the
// peer's send quota a little further.
//
// That erosion is unrecoverable, because the only trigger that can mint
// fresh credit for a message is onMessageStart, and it fires exactly once
// per LPM. When the residue finally exceeds the slack, the sender parks
// with a few bytes of the message left to send and zero quota, the
// receiver sits on an incomplete LPM with nothing left to read, and the
// stream is wedged for good.
//
// It only bites when a message is larger than the window itself. The
// shortfall maybeAdjustAdditive lends is measured against *available*
// capacity, need = n - (limit + delta - pendingData - pendingUpdate), so
// loans are also taken for ordinary messages whenever the reader happens to
// be behind. Those are harmless: catching up on reads restores the capacity
// and the ledger settles. A message bigger than the window can never be
// admitted by the window alone, so it needs a loan on every send no matter
// how promptly the application reads, and it is that permanent dependence
// on the loan pool that decays into deadlock. Hence the observed boundary:
// messages at or above shmInitialWindowSize (32 MiB by default) wedge,
// messages below it recover.
//
// Growing the limit removes the need for the loan entirely. The window
// genuinely covers the message, so oversized messages stop depending on
// delta and credit returns to the ordinary onRead -> WINDOW_UPDATE cycle,
// which is self-balancing. The limit is monotonic and converges on the
// largest message the peer sends, so it costs one extra WINDOW_UPDATE the
// first time a new high-water message size is seen and nothing thereafter.
// The window is pure accounting -- growing it does not allocate -- and
// inbound message size is already bounded by MaxRecvMsgSize, with
// maxWindowSize as the backstop here.
//
// Regression coverage: TestShmPipelinedOversizedMessages in
// benchmark/shmsccmp exercises the mono transport; this is the mirrored
// copy for the self-contained plugin engine and must stay in step with
// internal/transport/shm_flow_control.go.
