// Control-segment cross-process serialization lock (Linux / POSIX).
//
// The gRFC requires clients to serialize CONNECT writes / ACCEPT reads on
// the shared control segment using an OS-level mutual-exclusion primitive
// keyed off the control-segment name: an flock(LOCK_EX) on a sibling lock
// file. This is necessary because the control segment's Ring A is shared
// among all clients connecting to the same server -- the SPSC ring
// assumption only holds for the duration of one client's exchange.
//
// The lock file lives next to the control segment as "<segmentPath>.lock";
// it is created on first use with mode 0600 so only the segment owner can
// participate. The lock is released by closing the fd (Linux's POSIX flock
// semantics).
