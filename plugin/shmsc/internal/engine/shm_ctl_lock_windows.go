// Control-segment cross-process serialization lock (Windows).
//
// We use LockFileEx on a sibling lock file (analogous to Linux flock)
// rather than a named mutex. The named-mutex approach has a critical
// pitfall in Go: ownership of a Windows mutex is tracked by OS thread,
// but Go goroutines move between threads at the scheduler's
// discretion. A goroutine that acquired via WaitForSingleObject on
// thread A may be rescheduled onto thread B before calling
// ReleaseMutex; ReleaseMutex then fails with ERROR_NOT_OWNER and the
// mutex stays held forever. LockFileEx tracks ownership by HANDLE,
// not thread, so it is safe to acquire and release from different
// goroutines / threads.
